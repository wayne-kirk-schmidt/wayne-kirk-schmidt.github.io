<h1>Amplification Begins With Awareness</h1>

<p class="subtitle">A short demonstration post used to validate layout, spacing, and scroll behavior.</p>

<p class="lead">
Before a system learns, improves, or accelerates anything, it must first become aware
of what already exists. Awareness is the ignition point of amplification.
</p>

<h2>1. Why Awareness Comes First</h2>
<p>
Most people try to improve speed, output, or efficiency before they understand their
current patterns. But amplification without awareness is noise — motion without insight.
This section is purely here to create vertical space so we can test scrolling.
</p>

<p>
As you scroll, notice how the drafting circles remain fixed in place. The content should
float above them, maintaining clarity without interrupting the geometry.
</p>

<h3>The Real Purpose of a Napkin</h3>
<p>
A napkin sketch is not an artifact. It is a moment of transition — from thought to form.
Your site reflects that idea: light, unobtrusive, and always encouraging the next step.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Scrolling should feel smooth.</li>
  <li>Lines should remain readable against the washi texture.</li>
  <li>The sidebar should remain static while the content column moves.</li>
  <li>Nothing should bleed into the circles.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. A Simple Framework to Test Layout</h2>
<p>
Testing content density is essential. Too much text and the page feels heavy. Too little
and the design does not breathe. This section adds enough weight to see how medium-length
posts behave.
</p>

<blockquote>
  "A system is only as powerful as its attention."  
  — This blockquote exists purely to validate indentation, margin, and contrast.
</blockquote>

<p>
If this blockquote appears clean and stable — aligned, readable, and balanced —
then your typography system is behaving correctly.
</p>

<h2>3. Ending the Post Gracefully</h2>
<p>
This final section tests bottom spacing. As you reach the end, the footer should gently
appear without jumping or overlapping the geometry. The drafting circles should continue
to feel like part of the page, not a distraction.
</p>

<p>
If everything flowed smoothly, then your page is ready for real content.
This site now behaves like a true writing surface — light, calm, and structured.
</p>
